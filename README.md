## Guidelines

### Branch Naming

Everytime we need to work on a new feature, bug or any type of task, we need to create a new branch.
Below will be a step by step guide on how we can create and start to work on a task:

The nomenclature for someone named "Jo√£o Gomes" that need to fix a new "Bug" on a ticket with the ID "1234" and name "Update salary" goes like this:

`jg/bug/1234/Update-salary`

- jg - First and last name initials

- bug - Type of task to be performed

- 1234 - Ticket ID

- Update-salary - Ticket name

## Who do I talk to?

- You can always talk to your Team Leader or the repo owner for any question regarding this project.
