# Installation #

Install the following:

<code>nvm</code>
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

<code>next.js</code>
```shell
npm install next react react-dom
```

<code>jotai</code>
```shell
npm install jotai
```

<code>react-hook-form</code>
```shell
npm install react-hook-form
```

<code>npm i react-query</code>
```shell
npm i react-query
```
In this step, if there are any errors, you might need to downgrade your react version to 17.0.2. To do this go to your `package.json` file and on the dependencies change react and react-dom value to `"17.0.2"`
